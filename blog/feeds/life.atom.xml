I kinda successfully cleaned my PC before but I always am not careful with my stuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I fried my &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b250g-gaming-model/"&gt;ASUS B250G&lt;/a&gt; motherboard by breaking one of its SATA port during reinstallation. But somehow I managed to trick &lt;a href="https://www.ryanscomputers.com/"&gt;Ryans&lt;/a&gt; into doing a Warranty claim and got a new motherboard ( again from ASUS | that's a story for another day )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-i-broke-my-pc"&gt;How I broke my PC&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-i-broke-my-pc" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the reinstallation of my CPU, I put the CPU the wrong way and kinda bent it inward. That's how i broke my first ever computer's CPU. The PC turns on but it cant power USB 3.0 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heres what it looks like
